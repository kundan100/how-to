# how-to
Notes to be followed during repo lifecycles


## Create a repo
  1. with license only (i.e. without initializing Readme / gitignore)

  
## Branch: main
  1. Keep it stable, always. Merge here only from develop.

  
## Branch: develop
  1. Create from main branch.
  2. Use this branch only for merging the features here (not directly in main branch).

  
## Branch: feature/1000-setup-readme
  1. Create from develop branch.
  2. Use only for developing features. Once done, can be merged to develop branch.


## README
  1. Create a basic README file (on a separate branch).
  2. Then keep updating the README with features/development (in respective branches).


## .gitignore
  1. Follow the same as README.
  2. Create a basic .gitignore file (on a separate branch).
  3. Then keep updating the .gitignore with features/development (in respective branches).
